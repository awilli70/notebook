# ED 01 Class Notes 2022/02/08

City public schools have high superintendent turnover rate - why?

* Poor academic performance
* But really, changes to public school policy and school commitee, based on
  politician in power
* Push to return to elected school commitee, but the previous commitee was 
  incredibly racist

No clear plan or agreement, and education is complicated

- most people try to impart there own version
- Come in as educators, want to fix it but education is wrapped up in politics
  incredibly frustrating because it's a deeply personal problem

For the last 30 years, education has been a political issue, but nobody wants
to spend the money. Money comes from taxes, and cities have so many other
independent costs to deal with.

METCO

* earlier school time, affinity groups, couldn't participate in sports
* bussing was a commitment
* Set up as a temporary measure until Boston Public Schools figured it out
  * Now in effect for 56 years
* Hard to integrate with METCO because there was no second bus
  * Community effort to expand the opportunities of these kids

Only one school had a program for students to visit METCO students

Immersion experience - finding a community, especially with lack of prior
acceptance.
