# CS 111 Class Notes

## Semaphores

* Initialized with value N
* N threads can acquire at a time, any more must wait
* sem_wait acquires
* sem_post releases 1 for the semaphore
* Mutex is like semaphore where N=1

## Condition Vars

* Allows a thread to wait for an event in another thread
* Used to ensure ordering (A happens before B)
* pthread_cond_wait makes thread waits
* pthread_cond_signal wakes up one waiting thread
  * some implementations allow to wake up all waiting threads
* Must pass a locked mutex to cond_wait
  * While waiting, signal unlocks the mutex and reacquires it once the other
    thread signals

## Join

* pthread_join causes caller to block at join call until arg thread finishes
* Is a form of sync, though not as flexible as cond vars

## Barrier

* Initialized witha value N
* pthread_barrier_wait
* Waits until N threads have arrived at the wait
* Used to coordinate multiple threads that must complete rounds in time
