### Other Uses of DeathStarBench

* Used to develop SecLambda, an security tool to guard serverless functions
  * Passes function state to guard module, perform sec functions and tasks
  * Uses modified Container Runtime Environment to intercept calls
  * DeathStarBench used to measure performance impact of SecLambda
    (Social-Network and Media-Service)

* FIRM, a tool to detect microservices that cause SLO violations
  * SLO (service level objectives)
  * Improves overall performance/ scaling using ML
  * Tested on DeathStarBench

* Google Cloud Profiler, a tool to find areas of code in microservices that
  impact performance
  * Used DeathStarBench to track increase in CPU, memory consumption given
    workload of many requests/ transfers

### Tail at Scale

* Hedged requests - Replicate systems and requests, accept first returned
  response

QUESTIONS:

* Why does it work? A: Under reasonable parameters, higher likelihood of
  returning faster
* What is its impact? A: Higher network load, resource utilization

At scale:
Small microservices, replicas replicate all. Large microservices, replicas
replicate particular workload.

To find upper bound, increase number of replicas/requests until 99th percentile
worsens.

### Microservices and Debugging

* Distributed Tracing - logs of functions with timestamps, pieced together
  through context propagation
* Context propagation - information about which trace is which (ensures trace
  points relate to same request)

* Performance Diagnosis
  * Easier to use monolith, harder for microservices
  * In microservices, don't know the specific origin of performance issue
    BUT modularity makes breaking down the problem easier when it's found.

### Cross-App/ Cross-Request Interaction and Colocation

* Mutliple applications use the same set of microservices
  * Impact: Services become bottlenecks as they compete for resources.
  * Root cause of performance issues difficult to diagnose due to a single
    microservices becoming overloaded.

COLOCATION

* Incredibly difficult scenario to debug - force as many tenants onto as
  few clients as possible.
* Competition for shared resources, which the developer may not even know
  about with huge impacts on tail latency / 99th percentile.

Solution: Cloud Providers try to colocate services that at worst hog
different workloads only. 

### Multi-threading vs Microservices

Is multi-threading more efficient? 

* Yes, if only one instance of each microservice.
* However, incredibly easy to parallelize services by instantiating new
  new instance
