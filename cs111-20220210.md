# CS 111 Class Notes 2022/02/10

### Assumptions (from last class)

Virtual memory requires three assumptions

* Address space is smaller than the total amount of phys memory
* Address space is contiguous (to add a standard offset)
* Address space is the same size (creating a new process always
  allocates the same amount of memory, easy to find free blocks)

We've now relaxed the second two, and will relax the first one soon.

## Segmented Memory

xxx | P1 seg1 | P2 | xxx | P1 seg2 |

Note that memory no longer continuous and same size.
Before, we used base + bounds register.
This won't work because memory is now randomly scattered. Where would the 
""base"" go? We need multiple bases and bounds for one process.

Options:

* More registers (bad idea - h/w expense and limits)
* base & bounds in memory, allowing for a segment table for processes.

Left with some base addresses and associated bounds

|&nbsp;&nbsp; base &nbsp;&nbsp;   | &nbsp;&nbsp;bound &nbsp;&nbsp;    | &nbsp;&nbsp;valid &nbsp;&nbsp; |
|:--------:|:----------:|:-------:|
| 0xAAAA | 4000     | 1     |
| 0xBBBB | 1024     | 0     |
| 0xCCCC | 255      | 1     |
| 0xDDDD | 10000000 | 1     |

Valid tells if region actually exists


Virtual Address:

0x002&nbsp;0007A

&nbsp; **AAA** *BBBBB*

* 3 bits segment index
* 5 bits offset
* convert using table (take base add offset)
* compare offset with size - if $offset > size$ raise SEGFAULT

|Segment #|&nbsp;&nbsp;Base&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Valid&nbsp;&nbsp;|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|0|0x111111|4000|1|
|1|0xAAAAAA|1024|0|
|2|0xBBBBBB|256|1|
|3|0xDDDDDD|1000000|1|

0xBBBBBBBB + 0007A = 0xBBBBBC35 (physical address)

$7A = 122 \leq 256$ therefore no segfault


## Problems

Imagine 8 bit seg # and 16 bit offset

1. Size of virtual address: 24 bits
1. Max segment size: $2^16$ bytes
1. If physical addresses are 31 bits, what is the size of a segment table:
   size of table = $2^8$ = 256 rows x 48 bits = 1536 bytes = 1.5kb
1. Variable chunk size enables External Fragmentation which results in wasted space. Options:
  * Compact it down - reorganizes memory, but does A LOT of memory access (reads and writes).
    Ultimately, slow and invalidates cache.
  * Variable size - bad news. It uses up segments and makes the segment table less efficient
  * All the same size - Pages are all the same size. When we do that, we allocate pages as
    necessary, allocating the ceiling of the memory asked for.
    Result: Wasted space in the process, known as internal fragmentation.

Can't get rid of internal fragmentation without introducing external fragmentation.

SO:

What's the deal with paged memory? What tradeoffs are being made?

## Paged Memory

Process has a virtual address space

A page is a continuous space within virtual memory. Program thinks that it's
writing directly to physical memory.

Off in physical memory world, there are frames (physical frames vs virtual 
pages). Takes a page of virtual memory and stores it in a physical frame, where
not all pages are contiguous or in order. Invalid pages don't point anywhere in
physical memory.

PAGE TABLE:

|&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtual Frame Number&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical Frame Number&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Valid&nbsp;&nbsp;|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 0 | 0x0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0x5 | 1 |
| 2 | NULL| 0 |

VIRTUAL ADDRESS:

0x001 0007A

&nbsp; **AAA** *BBBBB*

* A is VFN
* B is PPN
* No bounds check because all pages are the same size.
* No offset can ever go out of bounds. Just have to check valid bit (and
  a little bit more)
