# CS 111 Class Notes 2022/02/10

### Assumptions (from last class)

Virtual memory requires three assumptions

* Address space is smaller than the total amount of phys memory
* Address space is contiguous (to add a standard offset)
* Address space is the same size (creating a new process always
  allocates the same amount of memory, easy to find free blocks)

We've now relaxed the second two, and will relax the first one soon.

## Segmented Memory

xxx | P1 seg1 | P2 | xxx | P1 seg2 |

Note that memory no longer continuous and same size.
Before, we used base + bounds register.
This won't work because memory is now randomly scattered. Where would the 
""base"" go? We need multiple bases and bounds for one process.

Options:

* More registers (bad idea - h/w expense and limits)
* base & bounds in memory, allowing for a segment table for processes.

Left with some base addresses and associated bounds

| base   | bound    | valid |
|--------|----------|-------|
| 0xAAAA | 4000     | 1     |
| 0xBBBB | 1024     | 0     |
| 0xCCCC | 255      | 1     |
| 0xDDDD | 10000000 | 1     |

Valid tells if region actually exists
