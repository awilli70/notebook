# CS 111 Class Notes 2022/02/10

### Assumptions (from last class)

Virtual memory requires three assumptions

* Address space is smaller than the total amount of phys memory
* Address space is contiguous (to add a standard offset)
* Address space is the same size (creating a new process always
  allocates the same amount of memory, easy to find free blocks)

We've now relaxed the second two, and will relax the first one soon.

## Segmented Memory

xxx | P1 seg1 | P2 | xxx | P1 seg2 |

Note that memory no longer continuous and same size.
Before, we used base + bounds register.
This won't work because memory is now randomly scattered. Where would the 
""base"" go? We need multiple bases and bounds for one process.

Options:

* More registers (bad idea - h/w expense and limits)
* base & bounds in memory, allowing for a segment table for processes.

Left with some base addresses and associated bounds

|&nbsp;&nbsp; base &nbsp;&nbsp;   | &nbsp;&nbsp;bound &nbsp;&nbsp;    | &nbsp;&nbsp;valid &nbsp;&nbsp; |
|:--------:|:----------:|:-------:|
| 0xAAAA | 4000     | 1     |
| 0xBBBB | 1024     | 0     |
| 0xCCCC | 255      | 1     |
| 0xDDDD | 10000000 | 1     |

Valid tells if region actually exists


Virtual Address:

0x002&nbsp;0007A

&nbsp;&nbsp; **AAA** *BBBBB*

* 3 bits segment index
* 5 bits offset
* convert using table (take base add offset)
* compare offset with size - if $offset > size$ raise SEGFAULT

|Segment #|&nbsp;&nbsp;Base&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Valid&nbsp;&nbsp;|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|0|0x111111|4000|1|
|1|0xAAAAAA|1024|0|
|2|0xBBBBBB|256|1|
|3|0xDDDDDD|1000000|1|
