# CS111 Class Notes 2022/01/25

Execution handoffs - note that hardware exception different from sw exceptions
Class refers to hw exceptions as exceptions

app    -> OS:  trap
OS     -> App: upcall
app/OS -> h/w: direct execution
h/w    -> OS:  INT or exception

OS:

databus, connected to:

* cpu
* mem
* network interface card
* i/o

Processor loop:

Fetch -> Decode -> Execute -> Fetch ...

Along databus, INTerrupt line (only one bit)
Upon action, device puts a 1 on the INT line

Don't want INT to interrupt a loop (to preserve atomicity)

Add new state to FDE loop, INT
If INT line is 0, after execute fetch next instruction
If INT line is 1, after execute handle interrupt then proceed to fetch

F->D->E->(F if INT = 0 | INT (handle interrupt)->F if INT = 1)

Also an INTA line - what this does:

* Device raises INT line
* CPU raises INTA line, listens on the databus
* Device places interrupt number on databus (each device has its own interrupt number)
  * CPU can then handle the specific device by looking up the the interrupt number on the IVT,
    begin executing code from that function

Memory has an interrupt vector table (IVT) for each of the numbers that can be put on the databus
Each number points to a function within the operating system (the handler for the device)

Interrupts and Traps both work in a similar way
Exception works at the execute point, has a separate lookup table - usually exception results
in program termination
