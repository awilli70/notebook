# Class Notes 2022/02/01

## Announcements:

* C programming warmup is out
* Homework 1 is out ungraded
* Project 1 is not out yet :( - but will probably release tomorrow
  * They're protecting against fork bombs
  * Writing a program that will work like the command line
  * Executes a program that the user inputs, uses `wait()`
  * Implement a pipe (output of 1 to input of 2)


## Class

### Process code pt 2

Forking a different process - `exec()`

Remember: child pid = 0, parent gets actual pid

Exec args: `exec(<prog_name>, <list of args>)`

`execvp()` expects a null terminated argument list

* exec-vector-path
* On error, will return -1 and set errno appropriately


`wait(int *status)` waits for a process to finish, returns its status

`waitpid(pid_t pid, int *status, int options)` - waits for pid, returns
child process status

`pipe(int pipefd[2])` allows for reading and writing to a file descriptor

pipefd[1] is the write end of the pipe, pipefd[0] is the read end.

### Scheduling

Scheduling types: 
* FIFO/ FCFS - first come first serve, first in first out.
* Priority - give levels of priority, decide based on criteria and serve
  based on level.
* SJF - shortest job first

Worst cases:

* Convoy effect: Long job, with lots of short jobs behind it (FIFO failure).
Can only go as fast as the first job
* Starvation: Short,
