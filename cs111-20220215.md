# CS 111 Class Notes 2022/02/15

### Practice Problems

24 bit virtual addresses, 2KiB pages, 10 bit PFN

1. How many bits in address offset? Number of bits to address each
   byte in a page.
   $log_2(2048) = 11$ bits
2. VPN bits = $24 - 11 = 13$ (Virtual Addr len - address offset)
3. Physical Address bits = PFN bits + Address offset bits 
   $10 + 11 = 21$
4. How much physical memory hardware? 2 MiB (1024 * 2048)
5. Virtual page and physical frame same size? Yes
6. What does OS and hardware need to agree upon? 
   \# bits in the VPN and offset/page size, register with PT address
7. Why does concatenating bits work for paged memory? 
   Because the starting address of each frame likely has a pattern,
   only need the most significant bits.

## Multi-Level Page Tables (PDBR)

What if page table takes more than 1 page of memory?

Use 1 page of memory to reference a bunch of sub page tables

Create the structure of the Page Directory and Page Table to handle
significantly more data

Page Directory (top level)

* Page Directory Index
* Page Table PFN (physical frame number of subpages)
* Valid Bit

Page Table (second level)

* Page Table Index
* Page PFN
* Valid Bit

If top level page table does not have valid bit set, the page
table simply does not exist.

Say we have address 0x0302CODE

* 03 corresponds to Page Directory Index (PDI)
* 02 corresponds to Page Table Index
* 0302 represents the VPN
* C0DE is the offset (as usual)

Benefits: Page table no longer wastes as much space tracking invalid
sections of memory

Downsides: Each additional level of indirection introduces more time
(Can be mitigated by putting these page tables into ultra fast mem)

## On Demand Paging

The **Translation Lookaside Buffer** (A cache for VFN to PFN mappings)

* Fully associative, stores complete mapping per process (not just
a single step on a multi-level PT)
* Hardware can then translate addresses without looking at the page 
table by using the TLB

Downsides: Does not store *absolutely* every mapping, but it does
store most of them. Relies upon caching policy (riveting stuff)

### Other stuff

TLB miss != PT miss

PT miss means page is not in memory

TLB miss means the VPN->PFN mapping is not cached. Instead,

* Look at PT in memory
* If PT miss then, page data is not in memory and we reach a
  page fault (exception on CPU)

### On Demand Memory (swap)

Store some page son disk instead of in memory

 * virtual memory not limited by the size of physical memory
 * accessing data on disk is much much much slower

Process:

* No Page Fault: read from memory
* Page Fault
  1. exception is raised, go to Page Fault Handler code in OS
  1. PFH code finds the page data on disk (usually in swap) and loads
     the page into memory
  1. After PFH returns, restart the faulting instruction which should
     succeed now that page in memory.

No free frames left, do what?

* Eviction policy (yeet stuff to disk, replace) - this is Swap
