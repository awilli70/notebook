# ED 01 Class Notes 2022/03/10

## Joe Burnieika

Covers deseg as:

* Student in 1960s
* Teacher in BPS (Dorchester) for 7 years (69-76)
* Parent
* Administrator (actually doing the busing assignments)

Tend to get siloed into specific views; offers a single holistic view

Shame that interest is only recent because a lot of leaders of the movement
are no longer with us

"Busing was a terrible failure - but what else was there."

Taught the Champlain school, which had no white students for 3 years, in 
contrast to the Marshall school (and only provisional teachers in the 
Champlain school, tenured in Marshall) 

Selected in 74 to begin doing the busing assignments, and ensure that the
exam schools were administered correctly + racially balanced

Every Friday, talked to Judge Garrity about any incidents that occurred at
South Boston during the week. Done in private, before public hearing (until
the judge was convinced otherwise)

At one point, also a dual school system with local public schools and
catholic schools; white flight ended up being largely towards catholic schools.
Possible because of Catholic Cardinal's power.

Did it improve the quality of education? Nobody knows - they didn't care. It was
a counting problem

Fixing it? No more elected school committee, breaking it down into micro-
districts (a l√† de-seg)

It needs to be torn down if we want to truly fix it (Joe worked under 5 
superintendents), and the size of the public schools are continually dropping

With dual system, wealthy Whites/ people of means moved out or into catholic
schools (leaving poor Whites and Blacks in public schools) - definitely racist,
but also a class issue

Everyone in power was ignoring the issue/ not encouraging the change; how
to view leadership? Nobody has learned anything, esp since de-seg. 
Everybody agrees that something needs to be done, but nobody wants to talk
about it (referring to busing). Often, people in power just tried to walk
away from it, because people want to avoid responsibility for what happened.
