## Torture-lite

### Notes on Wolfendale:

* Wolfendale not really saying anything about torture is permissible
* More concerned with what's at stake, has done empirical research
* When she says "Torture is deeply troubling" - example of what's at stake
  esp. during open torture phase of war on terror
* Appealing to idea of benevolent quarantine/ stewardship of defenseless
  * You have to take minimally good care of prisoners morally, since they
    are being deprived of their liberty
  * Allows room for religious exemptions

* It's a legal violation to take PoWs under surrender and torture
* Similarly, moral violation
* If you surrender, do you have the right to be taken prisoner?

No blanket claims being made on behalf of the prisoner.

> Under imprisonment, benevolent quarantine involves ceding the right to
> escape, and become treated as a combatant upon attempting to escape

### Subject Matter:

Is solitary confinement torture-lite? 
Interrogational vs Intimidational Torture:

* For information, you're not going to get it after 36 if not 1
* For intimidation, you're just going for cruelty (even torture-lite)

~~ EA sidebar ~~

Enhanced Interrogation: If it's not violent, it doesn't count...

Doesn't leave a mark, making victim less credible as well - this is intentional

But this makes it seem like only brutal torture is really bad,
even if this is not true in practice/ for psychological harm (can be worse)

Revisionist view: Earlier torture literature focused on ticking bomb scenarios,
Wolfendale doesn't really care. Situations in practice are incredibly rare
if they even exist

Paper starts by conceding that torture is a problem, is it solved by torture-
lite?

Wolfendale does not seem comfortable conceding that some torture-lite
techniques are not deeply morally wrong/ physically harmful

What if- we don't see it as taking prisoners, but hostages. If we are
scrupulous, we don't care about their wellbeing and thus enable torture-lite
as a morally legitimate practice.

No legal precedent for this, but that's a legal -- not moral -- distinction
