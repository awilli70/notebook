## Race Conditions

Definitions:

* Race condition - outcome depends on the order of execution (scheduling)
* Read-Write Conflict
  * Threads access same data in memory (i.e. a variable)
  * At least one access is a write
  * No synchronization
* Data race - race condition in which a read-write conflict occurs

* Critical section - section of code that should not run at the same time as a
  another critical section (one thread should prevent other threads from running
  the critical section)
* Mutex - data structure that provides "mutual exclusion" between critical sections
  * States: Locked, Unlocked
  * Can not double lock; if one thread locks, and another tries to lock, the
    other thread will block
  * Usage: Lock at beginning of critical section, unlock at end of critical
    section.

Why? If one thread pre-empts another thread due to scheduling, one thread may
change the value of a critical variable between two lines of code!

### Implementation Attempt 1

Global functions lock and unlock that assign values of lock = 1, unlock = 0

Busted, bc lock can be set and proceed without checking that it's already locked

### Attempt 2

lock has a while loop, which performs a check to see if it's locked.

Busted, bc multiple threads can lock simultaneously before the check is enacted.
