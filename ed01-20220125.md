# ED 01 Class Notes 2022/01/25

MOCS - massively online courses

* No back row, but no front row either!
* Fun to compare to Zoom

When asking if school was bad, what criteria? None!

So what criteria was used?

* Good for me, not necessarily others
  * Schools divide people into tracks
* College-going % - can be found in real estate as advertising!
* Does the school play to the student's strengths? 
  * Athletics/ extracurriculars, arts, electives
  * Do students learn to do something meaningful?
* Social aspects (think beach boys Be True to Your School)

## Purpose of Public Schools

What goals were accomplished?

* Diversity (in Virginia) - countywide education, rather than by town
  * Why does this divide exist in the US?
    * In Massachusetts, 1642 every community set up education
    * Must also be public, to allow everyone the opportunity to learn
    * In contrast, England's "public" schools were private schools for wealthy men
      * The state school system (actually public) made in 1870
* Evening the playing field of education/ becoming a member of society
  * If the teacher is doing all of the talking, where are social skills learned?
  * Was the point to be quiet and on time? - Yes, especially in industrial era
    * Anecdote - public school gym class: learn to take orders, private schools without gym
  * Tracked schools - why?
    * Incentives
    * Are kids in non-honors courses dumber? Are they really "down at the bottom?"
    * No dumb kids - just kids that didn't want to do their homework
    * Homework only "works" because you expect to go to college - students wouldn't want to do the work otherwise

Tracks are powerful tools to split apart the student populations - you may never see some kids
Independent schools don't have this

There's a difference between private and public for what schools are supposed to do

* Public schools have to accept anyone - including learning disabilities
  * To independent schools credit, they acknowledged they didn't know how to do it

What types of schools?

Public ~80-90%:
* Charters - but they often don't take "expensive students"
* Vocational/ Career in Technical Education
* Exam schools
* Art Schools
* Magnet Schools - attract based on specific programs
* Alternative public schools (subject based, schools within schools)

Private:
* Religious/ Parochial
* Secular
