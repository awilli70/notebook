## Raja's Distributed Tracing Time
### What it is, why it's difficult, and the 2 kinds

1. We can't debug distributed services.
   Each request involves a workflow (structure and timing of work done).
   Structure involves order, concurrency, and sync.
1. Machine-centric tech is insufficient in debugging. (focus on nodes,
   can't capture workflow)

### Event based tracing

```
            |          /<-> server <->|<-> backend storage
Frontend <->|<-> Client               |
            |          \   server     | backend storage
```

Features: tracepoints

Requirements: context propagation (needs to be perfect). A bug in
context propagation means that the worklow isn't properly traced

Trace points use logical clocks and get sent to a separate module to
construct the trace

Context propagation:

* In machines, carried in pthread local variables
  * Allows propagating context w/o modifying APIs!
* Carried across machines in RPCs
* Requires invasive changes to code to store the context
  through many possible coding patterns, including
  * Thread pools
  * Event based services
  * Actor model (what even are they?)

2 types:

* Event based - captures structure
  * Establishes happens before, propagates context, captures concurrency
    and synchronization
  * Useful for establishing shape where required
* Span based - captures relationships
  * Propagates context only on request path
  * Uses logical clocks to establish spans
  * More common, because: ?

## X-Trace and Dapper Q & A

### Other papers:

X-Trace shares causal profiling concepts in metadata propagation

Dapper has similarities and differences with X-Trace

Magpie is an older end-to-end tracer that serves as a backbone

### Settings for X-Trace and Dapper

Best case - large dist. system with shared communication protocol

Take lots of time to get set up

Dapper supports sampling, and is better for bigger dist. systems

### When would X-Trace/ Dapper not work?

Can't work on closed source solutions (Magpie can though)

Implementable but not useful:

* Local monolith without containers
  * Use device centric tools instead!!

Implementable and useful, but too difficult:

* Only a couple microservices, with causal relationships clear
  from logs (no extra tracing necessary)
