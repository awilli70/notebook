School Committee declares students white - 1966

* Therefore schools are not racially imbalanced, no action needed
* Doing everything possible to avoid change

## Boston 1974 *Eyes on the Prize*

CONTEXT: 

* Green v Board (VA, 1968)
  * School deseg should not be voluntary; schools should not be
  identifiable by race
* Swann (NC, 1971)
  * If everything was fine, pupils at local schools would work, but that
  under current circumstances we need to make changes at the cost of
  convenience.
* Keyes v School District (CO, 1973)
  * Outlines proof of segregation/ segregative intent in northern states
    (not just southern ones). When there is proof of de jure segregation, 
    desegregation must be followed.
* Milliken v Bradley (MI, 1974)
  * In 5-4 decision, Detroit denied deseg. Deseg ruled to be limited to one
    school system regardless of racial composition (suburbs not part of 
    the same district, so no 2-way bussing even though through redlining
    the schools were indeed segregated) - THIS CASE INFORMED GARRITY'S 
    DECISION BECAUSE HE CAN'T TOUCH THE SUBURBS

Garrity ordered city-wide bussing, including between South Boston and 
Roxbury. The remedies were evidently very difficult to pull off. There 
were safety concerns, and Freedom House ensured that resources were 
available. Elected officials were delivering racial messaging inviting 
uproar. First day in Roxbury was peaceful, South Boston dangerous.
South Boston organized a boycott, with 50% of white students not going to 
school.
