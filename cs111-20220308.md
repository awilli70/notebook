## Mutual Exclusion

Recall that lock with a while loop check didn't work because both
could enter the loop before acquiring the lock

Needs to be atomic!

### Test-and-Set

Uses a single CPU instruction to check the value of the operand,
and either returns 0 and assigns it to 1, or returns 1 and leaves
it as 1

```C
/* Assume that lock is a global variable*/
void lock() {
    while(tas(lock) != 0)
    ; /* no-op */
}

void unlock() {
    lock = 0
}
```

By definition, CPU instructions are atomic!

But this is a spinning lock, which means it will keep testing until
it can unlock

### Attempt 4

```C
void lock() {
    while(tas(lock) != 0) {
        //BLOCK
    }
}

void unlock() {
    lock = 0
    // UNBLOCK a blocked thread
}
```

### Fine vs Coarse Locking

Fine grained - many critical sections, better concurrency, more overhead, likelier to make mistakes

Coarse grained - fewer large sections, less overhead, less concurrency (worst case no concurrency whatsoever)
