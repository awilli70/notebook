# CS 111 Class Notes 2022/04/07

Recap:
When is it safest to write actual changes to a fs? After writing the Transaction End Block (TxE) to the log

* If all actions had been written but transaction was not logged, the transaction would be ignored (action shouldn't happen)

Create atomic operations of things that aren't atomic using transactions.

## File System Reliability - Fault tolerance and RAID

* Fault - failure in a component of a system
* Fault tolerance - avoiding component failures leading to system failures
* Durability - Data in persistent storage will not be lost

3 keys to fault tolerance

1. Redundancy - temporal
  * Takes more time
  * eg restart program/ run multiple times in sequence
2. Redundancy - spatial
  * Takes more space
  * multiple copies/ multiple times in parallel
3. Detecting when a fault has happened

### Checkpoints

* During execution, save the current state of the program
* If program crashes, load most recent checkpoint and continue
* Useful for long running computations

Pros:

* Because it takes so long, not checkpointing is **significantly** worse
* If something goes wrong, the cost of checkpointing suddenly becomes very worthwhile

Cons:

* Will slow execution down (pretty dramatically)
* Over many machines, becomes even worse - and can't store it locally (save over network to 
  multiple locations)

### Network Retransmissions

* IP may lose packets
* TCP provides a layer of reliability by compensating for lost packets
* End-to-End principle - reliability just needs to be between sender and receiver

TCP tools:

* Sequence numbers
* ACKs
* Timeouts and Retransmissions

If no ack is received, wait for timeout (well, it's a little more complicated) then resend

(Look up ARQs for more info)

This is an example of temporal redundancy

#### Checksums

Packets could become corrupted during transmission

Networking protocols use a checksum to detect this, and if detected packet just gets dropped.

Checksum is a summary of the data, appended to the end of the packet, and the receiver computes the checksum and compares (match, no corruption, no match, corruption)

### RAID (reliable storage)

Redundant Array of Independent Disks (avoids having to load from backup by storing in multiple locations at once)

* Many physical disks simulate one virtual disk
* OS & Apps see the virtual disk
* The virtual disk is more reliable/ faster than a single physical disk

How?

RAID-0

* Split blocks between two disks
  * Pro: higher throughput
  * Con: no redundancy

No tolerance for drive failure

RAID-1

* Duplicate blocks between all disks
  * Pro: Very high redundancy
  * Con: Longer write times

For n disks, n-1 failure tolerance

RAID-5

Parity block is a 3 way XOR

* 4 disks
* 1 stripe = 3 data blocks, 1 parity block
* Using parity block can reconstruct old data
* Alternates disk with parity block every time
  * Pro: No one disk becomes a hotspot
  * Pro: Maintains most of the capacity
  * Pro: Can reconstruct from failures
  * Con: No redundancy on parity block
