## VAIF

### Problems the paper is addressing

* Logging and tracing is important to debugging and optimizing
  * Ideally log everything, but
  * Tracing everything introduces significant amounts of overhead
  * Even if all data is being traced, how do we identify the problematic components
* Enter VAIF, an infrastructure that enables/ disables trace points
  * Keeps only the useful traces and narrows the search space to new problems
