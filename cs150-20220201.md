## RPC

How does it work?

1. Client makes RPC call, marshals args, and sends
  * Marshalling puts args in buffer/ serializes, converts ints from host
    to network order
  * Example:
    ```C
    struct Node{
      int data;
      void *next;
    }
    ```
  * Also dereferences ptrs
2. Server receives call, unmarshals/ puts data into memory,
   does work.
3. Server marshals result, sends to client
4. Client unmarshals result, returns from RPC call
