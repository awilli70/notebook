## RPC

### How does it work?

1. Client makes RPC call, marshals args, and sends
  * Marshalling puts args in buffer/ serializes, converts ints from host
    to network order
  * Example:

    ```C
    struct Node{
      int data;
      void *next;
    }
    ```
  * Also dereferences ptrs
2. Server receives call, unmarshals/ puts data into memory,
   does work.
3. Server marshals result, sends to client
4. Client unmarshals result, returns from RPC call

### How is it delivered over network?

Packets, which contain headers and data, addressed to destination using IP
and port.

Switches in the network route the packet based on IP (switches have LUT)

Destination reassembles data and sends to the process.

## Communication patterns and failures

Call-Response - client calls, server returns eventually
(client must ask for data)

* Blocking - Client waits for response, can not do anything else while
  it waits
* Non-blocking - Client can move on to next instruction while waiting for response

Chaining of call-response - one calls another

Publish/Subscribe - server pushes out updates to clients, which register to receive
and listen. (Think RSS feed)

Scatter-Aggregate

1. Client makes call
2. Call gets split among a bunch of nodes using RPC
3. Server waits for all nodes to reply before sending response

>         > * n *
> me -> o > * n * > o -> me
>         > * n *

### Failure modes:

Fail-stop - the process stopped working

* metadata process crashed
* servers storing the web index slide crashes

Byzantine - the process is lying to you

* some piece of hardware is arbitrarily flipping bits
* Think planes - alpha particle hits memory, flips a bit
  * As a result, planes have multiple computers running the same process,
    upon being outvoted shuts down

> Byzantine fault tolerance has a failure point as computers shut down.

### How do we handle them?

Detection: heartbeats, usually

Mitigation: Fault tolerance and majority voting

Diagnosis: ???

### Performance

99.9% latency - what is the latency of the last 0.1% of requests? (the worst of the worst)
