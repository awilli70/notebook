## Log20 Q&A

### Relationship to other papers we've read

* VAIF, with a similar idea but different method/ domain - cares about critical path,
  differ in how to determine which logs/traces to activate
* Dapper, a logging system that is very different from Log20 (flip a switch, get span)

### When is Log20 effective?

* Distribution of workload/ code paths doesn't vary over time
  * For this reason, backend tasks are preferred
* Entropy distribution is not uniform - if uniform, doesn't do anything useful
* **Single/strongly structured multi** threading workloads
* Only works with Java or a JVM language

*IT IS NOT EFFECTIVE WHEN*

* The workload is inconsistent (such as any user-facing code, where the user's decisions are 
  arbitrary)
* Frequent application updates, because the codepaths are changing frequently and you have to
  incur the training time every single update
* Not very insightful for dist. systems
  * Doesn't track inter-system communication
* Multithreaded systems
  * system does not account for simultaneous work - and could see the same code path running over 
    and over again, when it doesn't represent the actual workload
* Log verbosity (reduce the amount of logs to go through) - can't actually do this

So the best workload is a single trheaded fixed workload infrequently updated Java program with
little to no user interaction.

### Log20 in the wild?

* Can't actually find any production uses
* Only 3 forks, 87 paper citations

* Could maybe be used internally somewhere?
  * Mars Rover, or ntp clock, or something in the background

Does it have to be Java?

* Log20 relies upon dynamic analysis, bytecode was easy to work with
* In theory, valgrind can be used to do dynamic analysis for C/C++
* NodeProf, a dynamic analysis tool for JS

### Other metrics than entropy

* Gini Index, which analyzes impurities (similar to Shannon's entropy)
* Entropy and Gini index both want low values to ensure code coverage
* Both need to trace before inserting logs
