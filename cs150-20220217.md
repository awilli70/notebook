## Microservices

### Background: Web Services/ Monolithic Services

Web service short explanation:

* A loop that is capable of handling predifined requests in some manner

Monolithic service:

* One node, doing all of the work for the application

### Microservices and SOA

1 application is now handled by a collection of services

Monolith vs Microservice:

* Mono
  * [PRO] Easier to debug and write E2E test
  * [CON] Difficult to manage and navigate as they become larger
  * [CON] Components can't be scaled at an individual level
  * [CON] Hard to introduce new technologies
  * [PRO] Lower Latency
  * [NEU] Large build, but single pipeline
* Micro
  * [PRO] Small Codebase (easier navigation)
  * [PRO] Team independence
  * [PRO] Quick builds
  * [PRO] Easy Scaling
  * [CON] Hard to debug
  * [PRO] Able to use best language/tool for task

Other microservice benefits

* Fast delivery (Package and deploy in cloud by using containers)
* Scalable (By requirements, facilitates parallel introduction)
* Autonomy (Localized decision making by team)

### Containerization

Overview:

* What: Lightweight virtual machine with own environment, processes, network space
  (by which it means network namespace - interface to container different from
  network ports)
* Why: Challenge to update packages/ libraries, which may be used as a dependency
  in multiple places
* How: cgroups and namespaces to isolate resources etc. for a collection of
  processes

### Service Discovery

Problem: More services per app + diff execution environment, harder to find the right service

Solution:

* Allow services to communicate without referring to their network
* common discovery
  * location of provider through service registry and connect
  * can invoke functionalities without explicit reference tosthe services' locations
* Each service needs to know -- One Thing -- which then connects it to others
* Other options: Everything just broadcasts, but receivers need to be a part of the
  broadcast network

This simplifies service implementation and allows reuse of boilerplate between services

### Monitoring

Problem: Too many microservices. How do we keep track of all of them?

Solution: Monitors. Generally come with dashboard and alert system, and will:

Get metrics from applications and send them to central application to analyze (push)

Some applications keep calling for specific endpoint to get metrics (heartbeat/ poll),
also known as (pull)

### Container Orchestration (Who really understands this anyway?)

* Automation of container allocation and management tasks
* Why?
  * Abstracts away a lot of the infrastructure
  * Automates scheduling, deployment, version management, networking, etc.
  * Integrates with pre-existing container runtimes (docker, CRI-O, containerd)

Think k8s

### Fault-tolerance Comms

* What is fault tolerance communication?
  * Microservices use network to communicate between each other, but the network
    isn't reliable. Need to add resilience
* Why? Want to prevent network related cascade failures
* How? Wrap the request, if too many failures to an endpoint isolate it.

### Continuous Delivery

Problem: Pushing code is tedious and repetitive

Solution: Automate the pipelines. Often integrates with version control

Generally useful, but especially for microservices where a lot more stuff
is getting added at the same time.

### Chaos Engineering

Validate reliability through breaking by injecting failures

### Sidecar

Problem: As libraries get more sophisticated, developers are limited to using
those specific languages

Solution: Encapsulate communication related features and fault tolerant libs
in a separate process

Sidecars are self-contained, and application operators can monitor the behavior
of sidecars

### FaaS

Why? good for inconsistent traffic (cheaper to not have it up constantly) and
autoscaled

Cons:
Cold starts (slower) and debugging (HOW?? - dependent on cloud provider)

### Service Mesh

How the parts of an application share data

Why?

* Applying functionality to all micro-services
* Separate SRE/DevOps and SWE/SDE
* Heavy middleware + light application with complex business logic

How?

* Intercept network communications between services and make necessary changes
  (traces, perms, rate-limits, etc.)
