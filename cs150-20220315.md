### Cloud Load Balancing

Google offers load-balancing services to go between various backends

* Envoy based GFE
  * Open source high perf C++ dist. proxy
  * Reverse proxy handling incoming Google traffic (high traffic, goal of low latency)
* Balancing networking, dist systems, FOSS, low latency

1. User -> DNS -> Load Balancer (GSLB)
2. User -> GFE -> GSLB  \> Frontend -> Backend....
3. Frontend -> LoadBalancer
4. Backend DB

Envoy proxy

* Created by Lyft in C++ 
  * Open source, used by a ton of companies and improved by several
  * On release, lacked native support for distributed tracing
  * GOAL: Add OpenTelemetry (a tracing framework) to Envoy
  * Edge and service proxy

* Uses of Envoy
  * Ingress proxy
  * sidecar (to communicate with other envoys)
  * Internal Load balancer
  * Edge egress proxy

        client<--downstream-->Envoy<--upstream-->Servers
                            data plane

Enovy has a main thread and siloed worker threads (little inter-thread interaction,
to prevent concurrency related delays)

* Main thread handles admin tasks, and communicating config changes to workers
* Worker threads are responsible for handling connections for their entire cycle
* Multiple connections on the same worker thread
  * Run an event loop via libevent with nearly no blocking

Why is tracing tricky? Trace collection can not block the event loop
because it is single threaded, and carries significant perf penalties

* Threading: Implement tracer without blocking, accessing shared resources
* Dependencies: No libcurl, which has significant sec vulns
* Batching: Batching without locks, how would it affect perf? Is it worth it?
* Exporting: How should envoy connect to the trace collector? Create a separate RPC
  conn, or reuse?



OpenTelemetry

* Two recent frameworks have combined (OpenTracing and OpenCensus)
  into a single new standard, OpenTelemetry (doing Span based tracing)
  * Defines a common spec for:
    * Traces
    * Protocol Buffers (what does the data look like)
    * Create, Modify, and Export
