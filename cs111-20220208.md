### Stride Scheduling

While random is pretty close, stride scheduling attempts to get a more accurate
distribution.

1. Fairness - proportionate share scheduling
1. "Soft" priority (not technical name) - no starvation, everything gets to run
    but higher priority gets more time
1. Deterministic

Compare to priority scheduler:

* Downside: Starvation
* Upside: Turnaround time for high priority tasks minimized

What does it do that the lottery scheduler doesn't?

* Lottery scheduler is statistically correct in the long run, but stride
  scheduling is deterministic.

How does a stride scheduler work?

1. Compute the stride $$stride_i = \frac{C}{tickets_i}$$
   where C is a large constant
