# ED 01 Class Notes 03/01/2022

Reaction to MLK assissination:

* In the south, first one in line
* In the north, denial of segregation
  * Couldn't support MLK when discussion shifted North
* Kozol and Lukas - parents mobilizing for unjust cause under Kozol,
  vs Lukas describing it as rallying behind Kozol (Lukas creating white savior image)
