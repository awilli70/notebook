Kant - violations of rational agency is worst possible thing

As a result, torture is a extreme moral wrong/ inhumane by Sussman

Discussion of torture, traditionally, is more utilitarian

* Ticking bomb theorem
* Kantianism was more of a challenging view - this has reversed
  recently

Utilitarian is generally policy based - 
argument: can not authorize torture in advance (very clearly against the law)
BUT it can be rationalized after the fact (ticking bomb)

Sussman does not subscribe to this view
- not about counting the numbers.

Torture violating someones agency?
If they were being rational, would they have done something to require torture?
For example, Kantianism can justify corporal punishment as a way to bring
irrational people back in line.

Presupposing that the torture victim is guilty, or has information -
Sussman would probably want to consider a more neutral victim where they
~might~ have the information desired

But - if we have a mad terrorist and you want to find it wrong, Sussman does
not have the answer for what makes it especially morally wrong/
does not find that the distinctly troubling featue applies

If you want a moral judgement, is it your responsibility to restore a person
to rational ability?

Killing - immediate termnination of agency, but there's something more offensive
about torture without killing (is torture not better than killing then?)

Not claiming morally better/ worse, but is claiming morally more offensive

Torture from a level-headed, impersonal torturer - does this break Sussman's
account? Presumption of malice in heart of the torturer
But this focuses on the torturer more than the torture victim

Would someone choose torture over a bullet in the head? How then is it morally
worse or offensive? Does the perverseness actually do enough legwork there?
