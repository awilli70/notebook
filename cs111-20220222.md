### Management:

API:

* create: creates new thread, which starts at start_function passed in
  * Calling thread continues immediately after call.
* terminates when reaches the end of the start_routine or `exits`
* thread can wait for another thread to finish by calling `join`
* Thread can be detached if you never want to join it.

Join:

1. Caller waits (blocking) for target thread to finish
1. Caller gets the return value from target thread
1. Cleans up thread resources

Can only join a thread once because of 3.

Detached threads: ONLY CARE ABOUT #3
