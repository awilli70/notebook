# CS 150 Class Notes 2022/01/27

## Recap:

Processes are the basic component of a program.
It stores all code, static data, the heap and the stack (Memory),
Registers like the prog counter, stack pointer, and others (Registers)
Open file descriptors (I/O)
Virtual Memory to Physical Memory Mapping (TLB when process is running).

Allows for:

*  Isolation
*  Overcommit
*  Fragmentation

## Review:

How many processes can concurrently execute on 1 CPU? 1

How many CPUs can a single process run on? 1

What if an app is parallelizable (eg safari tabs)? Good Question

## New Material

### Thread based model - what does the threading do?

Why thread? Lower overhead than context switch, might want to share memory

File Descriptor - what it do?

* State of a file being used
  * a name so the file can be found and accessed
  * Current offset within the file

Per thread would have independent offsets, per process would have a global
offset, threads could trample on offset

Therefore, per thread is better for reading (can read at any offset), but
per process is better for writing (better visibility, allows for locking)
In practice, I/O and heap are shared, locks are required for safety

Kernel mediates I/O access, schedules threads based on how long active thread
has been running, blocking I/O, priority, pending I/O

### Context Switch

Swapping out threads/ process

What must happen? Registers must be swapped out either way.
If process, the TLB has to be switched out/ flushed, potentially flush
physical memory

Pre-emptive kernels

* context switch at fixed quanta
   * need locks to protect access to shared data
* Whenever they block

Non-pre-emptive (doesn't exist anymore)

* Only on block

### System Calls

Allows threads to access I/O devices (read(), write(), poll(), socket()).
Causes context switch if call is blocking

## Distributed Services

Examples: Twitter, Tensorflow, GFS

### The storage system

* Lots of clients
  * Send request to frontend process
  * receive data from frontend
* Lots of frontend processes
  * Receive request from client
  * Send request to metadata for file location
  * communicate with storage/ receive data
  * Send data to client
* Lots of metadata processes
  * receive request to storage location
  * Get storage location from storage
  * send storage location to frontend
* Storage processes
  * receive request to find data from metadata
  * send back location of data to metadata
  * receive request from/ send response to frontend

### Monolith vs distributed

Way to encapsulate resources needed

* M: Single process
* D: Many processes

Way to split up work:

* M: Threads
* D: Many Threads

Communication between split up parts:

* M: Sync access to shared variables
* D: RPCs, REST, TCP, HTTP, Raw sockets (gross)

How does it fail:

* M: It just crashes
* D: It's more complicated

### Abstractions for network comms

De-Facto: Remote procedure calls, a higher level API to preserve "function abstraction"
