### Distributed system performance:

1. Scatter-aggregate w/100 process, 99% latency is 1 second.
   What is the probability of request latency is greater than 1s?
  * A: 63% (1 - <99% latency>^# of nodes)
  * Importance: Very common pattern of computation, where speed is dictated by
    99% latency
1. Data replicated on 10 storage nodes. Whenever client reads, tries to read from
   every storage node simultaneously. How long does the storage need to wait to
   reply to the client?
  * A: Waits for fastest storage node to reply ONLY
  * What to do when response comes in? A: depends - some systems send out a cancel
    broadcast symbol that removes work from their queues.
1. Dist. service, responds in 100ms except for 5 minutes every hour where it stalls
   completely. Serial client (sends request after receiving response) monitors latency.
   What is 99% latency?
  * `Raja vs technology break`
  * A: 330001 requests are sent. (1 - 1/33001) is the percentile ~99.99996%. Since
     more than 99% of requests happen in 100ms, the end result is 100ms
1. What about if the client sends a request every 1s regardless?
  * 1 - 300/3600 = 91%, so it's in the longer window (~300s)
1. What if serial with 1s timeout?
  * 1 - 300/33300 = 99% at 1s, so 99% latency is 1s

Important intuition: model of requester matters in determining latency and actually
finding problems.

Additionally: Metrics don't give you all of the information

## Debugging single process systems

Applications run on a metric ton of other complex components

* Libraries
* VFS (virtual file system interface)
* File Systems
* Volume Manager
* Block Device
* Sockets, TCP/UDP
* IP
* Net Device
* Device Drivers
* System call interface
* Scheduler
* Virt Memory

The good news: most of these have abstractions, and have tools to test.
Debugging doesn't break these abstractions, so we assume that the problem is in the app

### GDB and RR:
So what is GDB and RR:

GDB (the GNU debugger)

* Allows user to set breakpoints, look at memory, see what is in registers
  * (Stops process at points in execution)
  * Can look at register vals
  * Can do stepping (execute next line)
  * Backtrace (seeing what called what)

### How does it work?

It's a wrapper - a parent process forks a child, which duplicates literally everything

Interesting note: a parent process is able to peek into a child process and examine
state

GDB is the parent process, it forks the program being executed, and gets to peek into
the child process as it is executing (see ptrace, and PTRACE_PEEKUSER, PTRACE_GET/
SETREGS)

### gdb tips:

C-x C-a, C-l to repaint if it breaks
* Brings up TUI mode, shows code stepping through visually

C-x-1, C-x-2, etc.

Up arrow allows you to scan through code
C-p and C-n go through prev and next command

b: add breakpoints

Can also be done through builtin python interpreter

Reverse debugging - recording error, then stepping back through steps leading up
to where the problem showed up. Allows for easier finding of non-deterministic
bugs.
