## I/O

### Device Controllers

* Part of I/O device that communicates with the computer and controls the device
* Several registers on the controller that the CPU can read/write from
  * Data
  * Command
  * Status

               memory     cpu
                 |         |
           | ----------------
        bridge
           |
        -----------------------
           |              |
           controller     | data reg (to and from dev)
           |              | cmd reg (instructions to dev)
           device         | status reg (current status of dev [busy/not
                                                               /ready])

### Programmed I/O

* Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) provides instructions for reading/ writing dev registers
  * x86: OUT [dst port], [data]
  * x86: IN [data], [src port]

* Memory Mapped I/O
  * Certain addresses mapped to device registers, load/store read and write
    from specific addr

### Device Drivers

* Code to interact with devices
* Developed by dev manufacturers
* Installed into OS, runs in kernel mode
* Syscall trap handler/ interrupt handler calls the device driver
* Plugging in device drivers allows for a wide variety of devices to be supported

### Polling vs Interrupts

* Polling - OS or user process asks the device if it has any data (sync)
* Interrupts - Device tells OS when it has data (async)

### Character Devices vs Block Devices

Character: Single byte/word at a time

One or two calls to a PIO instruction is sufficient (think keyboard)

Block: Large chunk, many calls may be needed to transfer a chunk

### DMA (Direct Memory Access)

* Device pointed to a region of memory
* Device can read/write from/to memory directly
  * Something else can run on the CPU at the same time
