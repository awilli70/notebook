# CS 111 Class Notes 2022/03/31

Recall from last class, linked allocation is fast & easy but difficult to access middle

### FAT (File allocation tables)

Remove pointers from data blocks and consolidate info in a table

    block    free    next block
    0        1       1
    1        1       -1 (NULL)
    2        1       -1
    3        1       7
    4        0       ------
    5        1       2
    6        1       -1
    7        1       6

    FILES
    0   1   2   3   4  5   6   7
    A_0 A_1 C_1 B_0 __ C_0 B_2 B_1

Can be moved into RAM for faster access, prevents data blocks from losing ptr information

Easy to find lost blocks without going through the whole disk

Hard drive probably not using FAT anymore, but usbs can use FAT16, FAT32, 2xFAT (FAT64)

### Direct indexing

i-node      data blocks
[] -------> [~~~~~~~~]
[] -------> [~~~~~~~~]
[] -------> [~~~~~~~~]
[null]


What is the maximum file size in a direct indexed fs with the following properties?

data block size 4kb
i-node size 256b
each db ptr 8b

ptrs = 256/8 = 32
ptrs * block size = 32 * 4 = 128 KiB

Direct indexing is the assignment (i_node with ptrs to data blocks)

Not a very efficient way of storing files

### Indirect indexing

i-node points to index node, index node points to data blocks

    [ ] -----> [] ------> [~~~~~~]
               []
               []
               []

ptrs = 32
total size = ptrs * ptrs * block size = 4096 KiB (4 mb)

Also double indirect and so on

Hybrid can either point to a data block or to index nodes

no limit to indirection (usually stops at triple indirect indexing)
