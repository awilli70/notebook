Process for finding data in memory

         START
           |
      Look in TLB  -> Fetch data  <<<<<<<<*
           |                              ^
      Valid in PT? -> Cache answer in TLB ^ <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<*
           *                                                    ^
       Page fault (OS ZONE BELOW)                               ^
           *                                                    ^
           |                                                    ^
       Free Frame? -> Load Page from disk into frame, update PT ^
           |
     EVICT A FRAME (policy) from some process
           |                                                    ^
        Is not dirty -> set victim page invalid in victim PT    ^<*
           |                                                      ^
        Is dirty-> dump victim page to disk,                      ^


All parts have dirty bit (TLB, Page Table) that gets set on writes

So why does the OS zero out pages when giving it to a process?

Pages may belong to old process, by zeroing it out it will prevent
the current process from reading its data (preserving privacy in the
abstraction)

So what policy should we use?

## Replacement Policies

* Random replacement
  * Not particularly good, but avoids some absolute worst case scenarios
  * Very easy to implement
  * Baseline to beat on expected workload
* Optimal Policy (Belady's MIN)
  * Replace page that will be used furthest in the future
  * So why not? A: Need to know the future. Not implementable
  * Can work on artificial/ recorded workloads
* FIFO (First in, First out)

            VPN|1|2|5|6|1|4|2|5|3|5|
        PFN H/M|H|H|M|M|M|H|M|H|M|M|   4 HITS
         0   1      5           3 3
         1   2        6           5
         2   3          1         1
         3   4              2     2

* LRU (Least Recently Used) - Slightly better real-world than FIFO

            VPN|1|2|5|6|1|4|2|5|3|5|
        PFN H/M|H|H|M|M|H|M|M|M|M|H|   4 HITS
         0   1  1       1       3 3
         1   2    2       4       4
         2   3      5       2     2
         3   4        6       5   5
   Downside: every read/write requires updating the ordering. Would be
   nice if we could store on the CPU... but we can't

* Clock Sweep (Second Chance FIFO)
  * Uses reference bit every time page is used
  * On removal, if reference bit set move to next entry
  * * represents reference bit set in page table
  * x represents reference bit
