## Two's Day

Why is Brookline not part of Boston?

* Cities have governments, and need to provide water
  * Brooklyn joined NYC to get fresh water
* Brookline had its own water supply already, and could stay
  independent. Had Brookline been a part of Boston, its history
  may have been different

Other map notes: 

* Charlestown is only part north of Charles, very densely populated
* Most other parts south of the Charles
  * Back Bay (west of the common) - laid out in a rational way, because the
    land was filled in from hills from Charlestown (Same with southern 
    Cambridge)
  * Right below back bay, South End - which used to be the south end of boston,
    but is no longer; south boston (southie) the actual south

Neighborhoods entirely distict (city of neighborhoods)

In 1920, to buy a house had to put down 50% of asking price and pay it off 
within 3-5 years. 30% of people had their own house - 70% rented

1929 - Homeowner's loan corp grades neighborhoods

A - Brand new, up to date; B - big houses, but old; C - Definitely declining
(loans still provided); D - Hazardous

Lines were drawn basically along race.

GI Bill

* 10% for civilian
* 5% for military
