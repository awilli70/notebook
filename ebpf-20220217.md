# EBPF Meeting Notes

## 02/17

Goals:

Understand eBPF and what's happening with it in the linux kernel

Easiest way is it's a way to insert arbitrary code into the flow of execution

Arbitrary code is in a sandboxed provable environment (no infinite loops or
kernel subversion with a restricted language that compiles down)

Can dynamically load in eBPF code at runtime to modify kernel behavior

Overarching goal - demo of implementation of solution to logging problem with
eBPF

Create a program that demonstrates the problem on the logging stack
 - Userspace program should not be able to destabilise the OS

Not trying to find every problem/ worst possible, but we just want to show:
Bad behavior, implement eBPF, no more bad behavior

Show that hookpoints are being hit in kernel with eBPF hooks

Coordinating the solution

1. Way to deploy the hookpoints
1. Way for scripts to be written that implement aspects of the solution
1. Demonstrate effectiveness of the solution
1. Responsible for presentation

Not even using the hookpoints, so the algorithm should be verifiably sound

Simulation, Implementation


Probably want to start working on the simulation from the get go

Back-pressure policy will reduce contention, drop policy will work

Simple Command line tool attempting to write at high speed, mitigate bandwidth, stay limited

Keep algorithm separate from the implementation

Meeting at 1:00pm Monday to tackle this in a deeper way

Using log generator, work on a way to make the problem repeatable - how to detect using metrics on OS - logging load too high, thread would slow down, take away load, speed up

Destabilise the OS - make the OS do the work

Try and attack it from

Podman
containerd

Double check power of VMs if the university provides them

BPF understanding:

Run arbitrary code in the kernel

Provides a way to run mini programs on a wide variety of kernel events
Commands are not in the kernel (power of eBPF)

Been in the kernel for a while, but with very slow adoption

1. Not looking for observability, but that may come into play
1. Networking - I've got a packet, will either handle or not handle
  * For eBPF, notion of handling a packet
  * In our case, handling a log / bandwidth limit
1. Security - not our use case

Need metrics and apply a policy

1st step demonstrate the problem (reliably)

* Show how shared I/O to a disk can cause instability to the executing node
  * User space program generates I/O to disk
  * Program that writes a ton of data over and over (and rewrites)
  * Want to show that disk bandwidth is being sucked up without exhausting
    disk space - prevent a different program from performing reads and writes

strace to show systemcalls

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
#print("Hello world!", file=sys.stderr)
#print("Hello world!")
with open("example.output", "w") as fp:
    print("Hello world!", file=fp)
```

`strace -f ./example 2>&1 1> example.out`

-f follows all subprocesses created

2>&1 merges stderr into stdout
1> pipes stdout to file

What we can do is take this example and make the string much larger
and randomized, then have OS write this chunk to disk
Then reopen the file to rewrite/append

Get a behavior of a really intensive program and see all the writes happening

pidstat [interval] [count] [-e prog]

We can use these kinds of tools to demonstrate one program impacting the
behavior of another

Use eBPF to see what's happening, get sense of writing own trace point

package - sysstat and iostat
(CentOS and Fedora preferred)

Next meeting Friday 2pm

Look up fio for io generation

## March 2 2022 

For class update: Use a modified kernel to show that the eBPF behavior works

Kernel doesn't exist yet!

Phase 1: Establish algorithm, show the problem

Intermediate steps:

  * Setting up the environment (REAL VM)
  * Demonstrating the problem (Demonstrate problem to show it's been fixed)
  * Designing the solution (Needs to use eBPF, need someone to play and verify)
    * We're going to use eBPF to make the solution, should be able to come up
      with algorithm independent of eBPF
    * Implement entire algorithm outside of eBPF

Phase 2: Show the solution (implement algorithm)

WE DON'T HAVE THE KERNEL YET, AND WILL NOT BE MAKING THE KERNEL CHANGES

Communicate that we will be making the script, not making the solution
