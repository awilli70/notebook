# EBPF Meeting Notes 02/17

Goals:

Understand eBPF and what's happening with it in the linux kernel

Easiest way is it's a way to insert arbitrary code into the flow of execution

Arbitrary code is in a sandboxed provable environment (no infinite loops or
kernel subversion with a restricted language that compiles down)

Can dynamically load in eBPF code at runtime to modify kernel behavior

Overarching goal - demo of implementation of solution to logging problem with
eBPF

Create a program that demonstrates the problem on the logging stack
 - Userspace program should not be able to destabilise the OS

Not trying to find every problem/ worst possible, but we just want to show:
Bad behavior, implement eBPF, no more bad behavior

Show that hookpoints are being hit in kernel with eBPF hooks

Coordinating the solution

1. Way to deploy the hookpoints
1. Way for scripts to be written that implement aspects of the solution
1. Demonstrate effectiveness of the solution
1. Responsible for presentation

Not even using the hookpoints, so the algorithm should be verifiably sound

Simulation, Implementation


Probably want to start working on the simulation from the get go

Back-pressure policy will reduce contention, drop policy will work

Simple Command line tool attempting to write at high speed, mitigate bandwidth, stay limited

Keep algorithm separate from the implementation

Meeting at 1:00pm Monday to tackle this in a deeper way

Using log generator, work on a way to make the problem repeatable - how to detect using metrics on OS - logging load too high, thread would slow down, take away load, speed up

Destabilise the OS - make the OS do the work

Try and attack it from

Podman
containerd

Double check power of VMs if the university provides them
