## Continued Setup

Michigan, like MA enacted public schooling

* Kalamazoo case - rich families wanted to not pay for school for poor
  families
* Supreme Court of Michigan required it, calling it a right

In the 1900s, public schools were much smaller, but would merge between
towns later.

Most states have the age at which you can leave school - in MA and CT it's 16.
Free public schooling mandated through highschool, push to have it through two
years of college

### 1900s schools

* Elementary K-8: 95%!
* Secondary 9-12: 4%
* College:        1%

Majority of population was uneducated, very few people would go on to study
past elementary school. Would drop out, and work on factories, farms (usually
rented). College is a dream for very few, and by and large the wealthy (men).

Why is secondary so low? The schools were there...

A: They needed to start work to support their family.

Teachers in secondary school were generally unmarried women - up until 1970,
if a woman teacher became pregnant, they would often lose their job. Men, on
the other hand, were usually principals.

Only time there were a lot of male teachers was during the Vietnam war, as
it was a way to avoid conscription.

By 1950, 50% of the country had highschool diplomas. Now, around 88%, but it
took a long time to get there. In the 1960s, a high school diploma was pretty
rare.

Thomas Jefferson "all men are created equal." is this true?

* Not really. Gender
* Race
* Religion
* Handicaps

So what's with this whole inalienable rights thing? Radical idea, given rights
that cannot be taken away just because of birth

> Education system is all about competition

* Perfect vision, not really clear what the ideal is or how to get there
* Limited amount of education as a resource, have to compete to get what is
  there
* Thomas Jefferson was looking for equality of opportunity, but knew that it
  wasn't exactly possible

Measure by standardized tests to provide to "the BEST"

Wrong answers called distractors, which are meant to trip up recognition
