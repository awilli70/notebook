## How do microservices communicate?

Many options - industry standard is REST, built on top of HTTP

Other options: RPC - built for backend more than web.

RPC is action oriented (expecting a returned result) rather than
RESTful APIs (resource oriented)

gRPC is a lightweight universal RPC with multi-lang support,
serializes with Protocol buffers (binary format, defined in .proto).
Runs on top of HTTP/2, but doesn't have monitoring/ error handling
infrastructure

RPCs are strongly typed (needs client and server stub to realize this),
while REST is a text based protocol

## Logging: Why?

Logging use cases:

* traceback when one or more services fail.
  * order, services involved

Needs: Stable and efficient logs - makes monoliths more appealing?

Strategies: 

* Relevance based logging
* Centralized log storage to monitor and interpret data (separate from the
  microservice)
* Queryable - need to be able to search through the logs
* Sufficient info: name of service, user, IP, correlation ID, time of arrival,
  time transpired, method name, call stack

What if they drift out?

* NTP - global clock
* Logical Clocks - counter based approach

Calculating RTT

* service 1 sends, logs time
* service 2 logs start, end (subtract for work time)
* service 1 logs reception time ((end - start) - work) = RTT

ELK stack - logs go through logstash, gets sent to elastic search (Open Source)
and then from ES to kibana (visualisation dashboard)

## Microservices (the paper)

* Best suited for overview and general approaches
* Not suited for guidance or developing new solutions

## Security

Current best practices:

1. Secure containers using the principle of least privelege (bare minimum 
   permissions)
1. Have a defined and secure API Gateway (single point of entry)
1. Isolation - every microservice needs to be totally isolated
