What are the political stakes? What is the context at play?
Hypothetical situations are difficult to extrapolate to a just/ unjust war

In individual and collective, the trouble is on the other side
How should the individual operate in relation to political society?
Is this a uniquely war case?

War needs to be set up in philosophy as something unique in some way. Individual self-defense vs collective self defense is different

How do we find a right answer? Is our framework narrow enough to find a right answer?

More interesting question: What are you doing in the first place? Once we have this, we can begin to assess the situation

In other words, why? How are we supposed to morally assess your activity

Why would Frowe want to zoom out to a more abstract collectivist account? Do we want to play this game?
They are often playing their own game, with their own framework, and may not have wanted it to zoom out

How do we get at the original motivations? May be responding to a response of a response, which at one point was tackling a relevant example

Individual either has to be morally right, or have an excuse. You are enlisted to fight and kill, and you should want to know why under individualist morality.

Where is the action to set up the account? The call to arms, if you ask questions then

Excuse vs Permission - once under duress, you have to work with excuses
Some people, however, are asking for permissions - so how, morally, can you argue that you are in the land of permissions (are you looking for a way out from an imperial perspective?)

What does it mean for whole nations to endorse atrocities?
