### Review

Sequential vs Random access - which is faster for HDD

* Most of the time being spent on a read or write is seeking and waiting for the platter to spin.
* If the needle is in the right place (sequential), less expensive
* Therefore sequential is faster.

Read vs Write - which is faster (HDD)

* Platter is spinning at a specific speed, and can't go any faster than it already is. Therefore doesn't matter which one is which.

### SSDs

* Uses flash memory (like RAM) but non-volatile and slower as a result.
* No moving components
* Array of memory cells (Some time needed to access any cell)

* Stores 1, 0, or erased, and can only write to a cell that is erased.
* To write, must erase first before writing.
* Cells die after ~100,000 erases

* Unit of memory access is a page
  * Not the same as VM Pages
* Groups of pages: Blocks
  * Not the same as disk/ file system blocks
  * Erase by block, read/ write one page at a time

* Reading a page is FAST ~10 us
* Write(/program) a page is slower ~100us
* Erasing a block is ~1ms (~1000us)


        |    A    |    B    |    C    |    -    |

        Write A -> Z
        In new block, copy old blocks across
        One write becomes 3 writes, 2 reads, and 1 erase of the old block (but
        we can hold off on that)
                       |         |
                       v         v
        |    Z    |    B    |    C    |    -    |

        This process is called write amplification.

To mitigate this problem, ssds have the Flash Translation Layer (FTL)

External interface which presents logical blocks, while the device contains
storage in physical blocks.

FTL helps avoid write amplification

* Instead of overwriting a page, the SSD writes the new data to a fresh page
* Re-maps the logical page to the new physical page
* At a later point performs garbage collection to re-free the memory available
  * Erase blocks only when pages are all/ mostly unused.
  * Reduces redundant writes from moving pages.
 
        |    Z    |    -    |    -    |    -    | Block 2     
             |
             |
        |    Z    |    B    |    C    |    -    | FTL
             x         |         |
             x         |         |
        |    A    |    B    |    C    |    -    | Block 1

FTL also avoids having hotspots (wearing out some parts of the disk faster than others)

* Accomplished by wear leveling, which ensures that each block gets programmed/
  erased the same amount of times as other blocks.
* FTL remapping lets us choose which blocks we write pages too (including page
  modifications)
  * In practice, round robin gives all blocks roughly equal usage.


## File Systems

Why file systems?

* Disks provide abstraction of reading writing to a particular address, which
  is incredibly hard to program!
* It is inconvenient to write programs this way (directories and files much 
  easier)
* Also means that programs are more sharable among different machines (not
  relying upon sector reliability)
* Makes it easier to ensure that programs do not collide when reading/writing 
  data 
* Provides security, such as perms. As a result, users must go through the OS
  and syscalls to enforce these privileges.

How to map the data in the files to the sectors on disks?

* The allocation scheme
* Disks are divided into blocks (contiguous sectors/ pages)
* How do we assign blocks to files, and in what order?

* Option 1: Contiguous Allocation
  * Allocate sequential blocks for a file, such that the file is sequential on 
    disk.
  * Need to keep a free list on disk to track locations and sizes of free 
    chunks
  * Pros:
    * fast file access = sequential on disk
    * Fast access within files
    * simpler
  * Cons:
    * External fragmentation
    * Growing files is difficult (run into the next file)
* Option 2: Linked Allocation
  * Blocks do not need to be contiguous
  * Each data block stores file data and a ptr to the next block in the file
  * Need to keep track of a free list, but the first free block can just store
    a link to the next free one!
  * Pros:
    * Easy to expand files
  * Cons:
    * Slow to access parts of files that aren't in the first block (sequential 
      file access could be random disk access)
    * More complex
    * Introduces overhead to track the next block
