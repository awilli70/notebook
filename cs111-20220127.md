# CS 111 Class Notes 2022/01/27

### Where we left off:

Abstract architecture diagram (see slides) will be returned to

Device sends interrupt, cpu handles interrupts between interruptions

* CPU will get number from device, look up on interrupt table
* Check last class notes for more details
* CPU and Hardware have to agree on LUT format

## Syscalls

Currently running user program asks to OS to do something for it

Uses the *trap* mechanism to transfer control, OS provides an API
implemented as a library. The user just has to call the API function,
library implementation includes the trap s.t. programmer never has to write
a trap directly

What are the specifics?

* Trap LUT provides number
* trap instruction in cpu (INT), gets number
* Processor executes instruction, gets number, handles execution of the
  the interrupt

Two pieces of software, so it's more instruction based BUT it can't just
work as a program. Why?

### Two modes

* Kernel mode (OS responsibilities)
  * Can do anything! No restrictions
  * Can operate directly on hw (heart of the OS)
* User mode
  * Cannot access kernel memory
  * Cannot execute privileged CPU instructions (certain instructions
    not allowed, eg loading a new handler address into an interrupt table)
  * Directly access I/O devices

Hardware uses mode bits to track current mode and enforces user mode 
restrictions. If mode bits not set, hardware will raise an exception

How do the bits switch? A: Change them with the trap instruction.
User should not be able to run any instruction that allows them to change the
mode. Trap instruction switches to kernel mode ONLY IF handler function is 
registered (only jump to locations preselected by OS)

### RETI

* Return from interrupt instruction
* Returns to user code where it left off (akin to a function return)
* Restores mode bits to previous state (could be user or kernel mode depending 
  on where the last interrupt happened)
* Re-enables interrupts
  * When an interrupt happens, interrupts have to temporarily be disabled
  * Otherwise, when saving state at the start of the interrupt an interrupt 
    could hurt things
  * Similarly restoring state
  * While handling interrupt, possible to get a new interrupt safely

## Processes

(Raja vs Dave)

Process: Currently running program (as opposed to file sitting on disk)

### Parts of a process:

* Registers
  * Stack Ptr
  * Prog Ctr
  * LR
  * Data registers
* Open file descriptors
* Address space (what memory is allocated)
* Memory
  * Code
  * Static Vars
  * Heap
  * Stack

What does it mean to be blocked? Process can not make progress for some reason
Better to block to reallocate the processor (allowing the processor to do work
while program waits (eg during a file read))

### Process control block (PCB)
Struct details - see slides

Storage of machine state of a process when context switching

Context sub-struct contains registers, ofile (open files)

Not used in machine state: PID (process id, proc_state [Is the process running,
ready, blocked, etc.])

Parent process (all processes were forked from another process)

### Process code

Create a new process: `fork()`

* Takes the current process and makes an exact copy of it in every way
  * only difference is return value from `fork()` - negative means error,
    0 means child, greater than 0 means parent and is childs PID

Get process id: `getpid()`
