# CS 150 DCC Class Notes 2022/01/25

## Finshing up last lecture
[[homework.md]]
Don't actually have to succeed in project, just learn
Teams of 3 for discussions + readings + projects (same teams of 3)

## Homework
None yet, first summary is due by L6

## What is cloud computing?

Computing on tap for a price - someone else pays for infrastructure

Software/apps on rented, shared infra, running in datacenters

* 1 or more datacenters same org, cloud
  * Cloud and apps same org: private
  * Different org: public

### What makes them different in practice?

Visibility - in private cloud, you know it's your problem. Public cloud,
it could be the public cloud providers problem

Security - how can you trust a cloud provider? How can you trust other tenants?
Is information leaked to those other tenants?

### So why public cloud?
* Lower upfront infrastructure costs
* More fault tolerance, maybe

## Cloud Ecosystem

### Distributed systems at every layer:

* Applications - Cloud/ Tenant
* Virtualization (think virtual machines, multiplexing) - Cloud
* Network layer (machines communicating) - Cloud
* Hardware layer (actual machine interface) - Cloud
* Wide area network
  * ISPs own cables and manage them. 
  * Local ISPs connect to clients and within cities (also known as eyeball)
  * Transit ISPs connect between Local ISPs
  * Tier 1 ISPs connect between eachother (continent-level) and Trasit ISP
  * Payment goes up the tiers, horizontal/ peering links are exchanging equal
    traffic and do so for free

## How does it all work? (Processes)

### Definitions
Dist system: set of autonomous computing elemetns that appear to its users as 
a single coherent system (for a common goal)

Processes: Most basic block of a distributed system

Virtualization: Sharing underlying resource while preserving abstraction of
dedicated access (TURTLES ALL THE WAY)

* Entire machine
  * Hardware
    * Processes

Within individual or multiple machines (frictionless multiplexing)

### Processes
A process encapsulates all info needed to share hardware w/ other processes
(synonymous with apps)

What does a stack look like (single machine)?

* Processes 1 ... n
* Libraries (Common functionality, like glibc)
* Kernel    (Resource management through multiplexing)
* Hardware  (CPU, memory, disk, network card, registers)

What does a process need to hold?

* Memory
  * Code
  * Static data/ globals
  * Heap
  * Stack
* Registers (super close to the CPU, very speedy)
  * Program Counter/ ptr (what is the current instruction)
  * Stack ptr
  * Heap ptr (special guy)
  * Gen purpose registers
* File I/O
  * Open fds (point to files being written).
    No difference between network and on disk

A processes memory is virtual

* Physical memory has addresses from 0x00 to 0xFF
* Each program has virtual memory from 0x00 to 0xFF
  * No guarantee that virtual address 0x00 points to physical address
  * Could be hugely splintered across physical memory, or even disk

Why? 

* Can allocate large amounts of virtual memory, and have it splintered
throughout physical memory (Address Fragmentation). 
* Allows use of more memory than physically available as long as not all 
memory is needed simultaneously (can be stored on disk)
* Prevents access from one application to another

Mapping from VM to PM is stored in process abstraction. It gets put in a 
special cache (the Translational Lookaside Buffer) when process is running
