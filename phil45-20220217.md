Walzer - combatant v combatant always ok, and combatant v civilian is based on intention(?).

But when you start looking at civilians, things start getting really messy (looking at intent, and number)

Walzer revises the doctrine of double effect to account for the role of intention/ express due regard for ordinary civilians

If we say that soldiers cannot morally fight according the rules of jus in bello, we brand them as criminals (frowe) - what? We can consider them transgressors in the sense of morality, but not criminals in the face of law

Why is frowe worried about the moral dubiousness of unjust combatants obeying legal rules of war; the problem appears to be looking for an excuse

Too much pressure is being but on the unjust (war) combatant - in modern warfare, is the war really between combatants?

Is this concern about post-war retribution? Just-War theorists would argue that it is important to punish those that made incorrect decisions so if you are not sympathizing with the soldier, your are condoning their punishment
Not just an option to punish, but a duty

Does this make sense? If you aren’t a retributivist, there is no need to justify the soldier because you don’t feel like one fighting in an unjust war deserves punishment as a result.

The core in bello issue - you CAN NOT target combatants. By blending with policy, you run into issues with intent (why does it create a better image of the combatant when they target civilians for good intent)

Are we looking at law, or looking at morality?
