# CS 150 Class Notes 2022/02/15

So... we were talking about CoZ.

Previously, dealing with single node tools (like perf, gprof, etc.)

How do they work?

* Randomly sample functions to profile during execution
* Records many performance related events
* Common use case: Show slowest functions as per CPU-time used

Can also show stats re: page faults, tlb misses, log points in kernel

Why doesn't this work for multi-threaded programs?

* Bottlenecks and Slack - looking at the slowest function doesn't tell
  the whole story, because it may be waiting for one or more other functions
  to complete.
* Misses critical paths (the slowest concurrent thread/ path to program end)

ASCII DIAGRAM (will break in md)

         start
        /     \
    f1():2s f2():50s
      |       |
   f3():90s f5():50s
        \    /
         end

CRITICAL PATH is of f2 and f5 (total 100s vs 92)

### Visualization

Flame graphs:

* Width is time of execution across samples, and functions stacked on top
  are the functions it called. Gets a sense of where slowdowns are by func

### CoZ review

F G F

G H G

f-10 g-5 h-8 $T_o = 25s$, slack of 7s

**Speed up f 50%**

F &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F

G //5s// G H //5s// H G (10 + 5 + 5 + 8 = 28)

Slack decreases to 3s going the other way, speedup of 7s

$T_o = 25 + \texttt{delay} = 35s$, $T_s = T_o + \texttt{critical path time} = 35 - 28 = 7s$

Speedup pctg = $1 - (T_o - T_s)/T_o$
