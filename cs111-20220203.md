Time sharing - switching between processes

Scheduling policy metrics:

* Turnaround time (time required to complete a process)
  * (completion time - arrival time) - as many as quickly as possible
* Throughput
  * Number of proceeses completed per time unit
* Response time (Delay from a request/event until the process responds to it)
  * (start time - ready time) - best user experience/ responsiveness of programs
* CPU Utilization
  * % of time the CPU is doing something

Process   Arrival   CPU   I/O   CPU

P1        t=0       4     1     1

P2        t=1       2     2     2

P3        t=4       4     2     2

CPU P1 P2 >| P1 -- >| P2 P1 P2 >| P3 -- -- >| -  -  P3 >|

I/O -  -  -  P2 >| -  P1 -  -  -  -  -  -  -  P3 >| -  -

Throughput = 3 proc/ 18 ms (1/6 proc/ms)

CPU Utilization = 16ms used/ 18ms total = 88.89

MLFQ:

What is it trying to solve, how does it work?

1. Don't know run time, balance turnaround and response
1. Multiple Q's , different priorities.
1. In highest priority Q, run round robin.
  * If highest priority empty, move to next highest priority queue

* New processes go in the highest priority Q
* If process has been running and uses up time, move down to next Q
